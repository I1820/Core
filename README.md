# I1820
## Introduction
This program does [Kaa](http://www.kaaproject.org/) administration things with CLI
in the first place, I think
using a complex CLI is better than using a simple GUI :D.  
When 18.20 decide to leave us alone, we created improved version of it,
in this version we provide everything you need in simple package.
## Basis
Basis of this project comes from [SDN101 project](https://github.com/elahejalalpour/SDN101).

## Development
I think for using this project in development phase,
it's better to use virtual environment:
```sh
pyvenv $PROJECT_ROOT
. $PROJECT_ROOT/bin/activate
$PROJECT_ROOT/run.sh
```
