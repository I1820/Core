# Kaa.py
## Introduction
This program do [Kaa](http://www.kaaproject.org/) administration things with CLI, I think
using a complex CLI is better than using a simple GUI :D
For server configuration and other things we want, we connect
to 18.20 information server :D
## Basis
Basis of this project comes from [SDN101 project](https://github.com/elahejalalpour/SDN101).

## Development
I think for using this project in development phase,
it's better to use virtual environment:
```sh
pyvenv $PROJECT_ROOT
. $PROJECT_ROOT/bin/activate
$PROJECT_ROOT/run.sh
```
